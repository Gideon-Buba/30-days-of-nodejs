# 30 Days of Node.js

Welcome to my 30 Days of Node.js journey! ðŸš€ This project is a compilation of my progress as I explore the world of Node.js. I'm following the guide from [Nodejsera](https://www.nodejsera.com/30-days-of-node.html) to enhance my skills and build awesome projects.

## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful runtime environment for server-side JavaScript. This 30-day challenge is designed to deepen my understanding of Node.js, from basic concepts to advanced topics.

## Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of Node.js, including modules, npm, and the event loop.
- Build practical applications to solidify my knowledge.
- Explore popular Node.js frameworks like Express.
- Dive into asynchronous programming and callbacks.

## Resources

I'm primarily using the [Nodejsera 30 Days of Node.js](https://www.nodejsera.com/30-days-of-node.html) guide. It provides a structured and hands-on approach to mastering Node.js.
